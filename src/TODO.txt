To do:
- Dropdown in search to reflect shelf after refresh (Add books from search to "ourBooks"?) 
- Check everything: https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view

Done:
- Routing.
- For search, make sure using 'all' books instead of just "ourBooks" 
- Make home a new component (for cleaner routing)
- Separate search into component page.
- Show books with search instead of consoling.
